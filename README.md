[Dev Home](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-home) is a new experience from Microsoft aiming to give developers more power on Windows.

- **Customizable widgets:** Use the dashboard to monitor workflows, track your dev projects, coding tasks, Azure DevOps queries, GitHub issues, pull requests, available SSH connections, and system CPU, GPU, Memory, and Network performance.
- **Environment for developers:** Set up your development environment on a new device or onboard a new dev project.
- **Extensibility:** Set up widgets that display developer-specific information. Create and share your own custom-built extensions.
- **Maximize productivity:** Create a Dev Drive to store your project files and Git repositories.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Configuration

The [machine configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home/setup#machine-configuration) tool utilizes the Dev Home GitHub Extension, but isn't required to clone and install apps. The app installation tool is powered by winget.

**Popular apps**

The machine configuration tool provides a list of popular apps when selecting applications to install. This is currently a hard-coded list of applications that have been popular with developers on Windows. Popularity was determined by high levels of installation and usage. As this is a moment in time, we are not accepting submissions for this list. We're looking to improve the experience with [Suggested Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/375) so the list can be optimized for developers.

## üß∞ Dev Home Extensions

Here're some popular extensions:

- [Dev Home GitHub Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/devhomegithubextension)
